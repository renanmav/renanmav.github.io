## Intro

Microstrip Antennas are low-profile antennas applied in high-performance aircraft, spacecraft, satellite and missile applications, where size, weight, performance, ease of installation and aerodynamic profile are constraints. Civilian applications includes mobile communication and wireless conection. [1]
Another important theme for this post are metamaterials. Metamaterials are specific dispositions of unit cells with peculiar electrical properties. These materials present properties that doesn't exist on nature. Because his dispositions, electrical permissivity and magnetic permeability are negatives. This produces negative refraction, which makes the eletromagnetic radiation behave diferent from expected. [2]
